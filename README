Chordbook Compilation Chain (v0.2)

This package provides a compilation toolchain for latex
chordbook. Some modifications have been done to the different files in
order to match my desire. The main goal of this package is to have a
simple make that allow to build a good looking chordbook without the
all the c code to compile as provided in the original songs
distribution.

Currently this package is distribued with a chordbook written and
desinged by one of my co-worker at the lab. It is provided with
respect to its Creative Commons Licence.

All other files are subject to the GNU GPLv2 except if another licence
is precised.
