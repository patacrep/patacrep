	* make-index : simplified algorithm to produce the index file. The 
	programm depends less on the type of the index (authors or title). 
	It produces the same listing in alphabetical order. Also removed 
	the ignore "La/Les/Le/The/etc." rules.
	
	* makefile : removing songs/*.sbd from the makefile as it is no
