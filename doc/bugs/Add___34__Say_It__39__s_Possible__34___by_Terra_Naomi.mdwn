Simple song to play but must be very hard to sing right. Here is a youtube video. In the authors channel, there is a video tutorial to play this song. This song is mainly intresting to me because of its strumming pattern an pretty unusual chords.

First version added. The chords are correctly placed for the first verse but the rest of the song has to be formatted to follow the same pattern.
