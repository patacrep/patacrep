have to perform "make clean" after adding a song to have an updated index

> This issue, pretty annoying I must admit, comes from the "one file, one song" feature. It must be possible to find a workaround by using an intermediate file storing the list of files included into songs.sbd. Using this approach, the dependency lies on the fact that the list of actual files is different from the stored list. The list may even be stored as comment in the header of the songs.sbd file.
