"> This issue, pretty annoying I must admit, comes from the \"one file, one "
"song\" feature. It must be possible to find a workaround by using an "
"intermediate file storing the list of files included into songs.sbd. Using "
"this approach, the dependency lies on the fact that the list of actual files "
"is different from the stored list. The list may even be stored as comment in "
"the header of the songs.sbd file.\n"
