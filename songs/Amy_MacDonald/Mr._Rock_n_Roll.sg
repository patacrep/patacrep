  \beginverse
    \[D]So called Mr. Rock 'n Roll he's dancing on his own again
    Talking on his phone again to someone, who tells him that his
    \[G]Balance is low, he's got nowhere to go, he's on his own again
    {\nolyrics \[D D4 D6/9 D] \rep{2}}
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Rock chic of the century is acting like she used to be
    Dancing like there's no one there before she ever seemed to care now
    She wouldn't dare, it's so rock 'n roll to be alo-(h)one
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    And they'll \[A4]meet one day far away and say
    \[Em7]{I wish} I was something more
    And they'll \[A4]meet one day far away and say
    \[Em7]{I wish} I knew you, I wish I knew you before
    {\nolyrics \[D D4 D6/9 D] \rep{4}}
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Mrs. Black and White she's never seen a shade of grey
    Always something on her mind, every single day
    But now she's lost her way, and where does she go from here?
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Mr. Multicultural sees all that one could see
    He's living proof of someone very different to me
    But now he want's to be free, free so he can see
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    He'll say \[Em7]{I wish} I knew you
    \[A4]{I wish} met you when \[G]time was still on my \[D]side
    She'll say \[Em7]{I wish} I knew you
    \[A4]{I wish} I loved you \[G]before I was his \[A4]bride
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    And so they must be depart too many moral broken hearts
    But I've seen that all before in TV, books and films and more
    And there's a happy ending, every single day
  \endverse
