  \beginverse
    Well, it \[C]ain't no use to \[G7]sit and wonder \[Am]why, babe \[G]
    Even if you \[F]don't know by \[C]now
    It \[C]ain't no use to \[G]sit and wonder \[Am]why, babe \[G]
    \[D]It will never do some\[G]how \[G7]
    \[C]When your rooster crows at the \[C7]break of dawn
    \[F]Look out your window \[D]and I'll be gone
    \[C]You're the \[G]reason I'm \[Am]travellin' \[G]on \[F]
    \[C]Don't think twice\[G7], it's all \[C]right
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
    That light I never known
    And it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
    I'm on the dark side of the road
    But I wish there was something you would do or say
    To try and make me change my mind and stay
    But we never did too much talkin' anyway
    But don't think twice, it's all right
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
    Like you'd never done before
    It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
    I can't hear you anymore
    I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' walkin' down the road
    I once loved a woman a child I'm told
    I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
    But don't think twice, it's all right
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    So long honey, babe
    Where I'm bound, I can't tell
    But goodbye's too good a word, babe
    So I'll just say fare thee well
    I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
    You could have done better but I don't mind
    You just kinda wasted my precious time
    But don't think twice, it's all right
  \endverse
