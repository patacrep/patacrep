  \beginverse
    \[C] Said I \[G]remember \[Am]when we used to sit \[F]
    \[C] In the govern\[G]ment yard in \[Am]Trenchtown \[F]
    \[C] Oba, ob-\[G]serving the \[Am]hypocrites \[F]

  \beginverse*
    Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost
    Along the way
    In this bright future, you can't forget your past
    So dry your tears I say
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Said I remember when we used to sit
    In the government yard in Trenchtown
    And then Georgie would make the fire light
    Log wood burnin' through the night
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Then we would cook corn meal porridge
    Of which I'll share with you
    My feet is my only carriage
    So I've got to push on through
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    But while I'm gone
  \endverse

  \begin{bridge}
    \[C] Everything's gonna \[G]be alright
    \[Am] Everything's gonna \[F]be al\[G]right
    \rep{4}
