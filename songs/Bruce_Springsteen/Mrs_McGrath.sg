  \beginverse
    ``Oh, \[Dm]Mrs. McGrath'', the sergeant said
    ``Would you \[F]like to make a soldier \[C]out of your son Ted
    With a \[C]scarlett coat and a big cocked hat
    Oh, Mrs. McGrath, wouldn't \[Dm]you like that?''
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    With your \[Dm]too-ri-a, fol-di-diddle-da
    \[F]Too-ri, oor-ri, \[C]oor-ri-a
    With your \[C]too-ri-a, fol-di-diddle-da
    Too-ri, oor-ri, \[Dm]oor-ri-a
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Now, Mrs. McGrath lived on the shore
    For the space of seven long years or more
    She spied a ship coming into the bay
    With her son from far away
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    ``Oh captain dear, where have you been
    You've been sailing the Mediterranean
    Have you news of my son Ted
    Is he living or is he dead?''
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Up came Ted without any legs
    And in their place, two wooden pegs
    She kissed him a dozen times or two
    And said, ``My god, Ted is it you?''
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    ``Now, were you drunk or were you blind
    When you left your two fine legs behind?
    Or was it walking upon the sea
    That wore your two fine legs away?''
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    ``No, I wasn't drunk and I wasn't blind
    When I left my two fine legs behind
    A cannon ball on the fifth of May
    Tore my two fine legs away''
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    ``Oh, Teddyboy'', the widow cried
    ``Your two fine legs were your mother's pride
    Stumps of a tree won't do at all
    Why didn't you run from the cannon ball?''
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    ``All foreign wars I do proclaim
    Live on the blood and the mothers' pain
    I'd rather have my son as he used to be
    Than the king of America and his whole Navy''
  \endverse
