    \[G]Well, I thought I heard the captain say
    ``Pay me my \[D]money down
    Tomorrow is my sailing day
    Pay me my \[G]money down''
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    Pay me, pay me
    Pay me my \[D]money down
    Pay me or go to jail
    Pay me my \[G]money down
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Soon as that boat was clear of the bar
    Pay me my money down
    He knocked me down with the end of a spar
    Pay me my money down
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Well if I'd been a rich man's son
    Pay me my money down
    I'd sit on the river and watch it run
    Pay me my money down
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    \[B&]Well, I wish I was Mr. Gates
    Pay me my \[F]money down
    Haul my money in egg crates
    Pay me my \[B&]money down
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    \[G]Well, 40 nights, nights at sea
    Pay me my \[D]money down
    Captain worked every last dollar out of me
    Pay me my \[G]money down
