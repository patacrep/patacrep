  \beginverse
    You never walk alone
    And you're forever talking on the phone
    I've tried to call you names
    But every time it comes out the same
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    I'm still waiting for your heart
    Cause I'm sure that some day it's gonna start
    You'll be mine to hold each day
    But 'till then, this is all that I can say
  \endverse
