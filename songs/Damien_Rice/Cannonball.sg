  \beginverse
    \[B&m] Still a little \[F#]bit of your \[C#]taste in \[G#]my mouth
    \[B&m] Still a little \[F#]bit of you \[C#]laced with \[G#]my doubt
    \[B&m] Still a little \[F#]hard to say \[C#] \[G#]
    What's \[D#m7]going on \[G#]
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness
    Still a little bit of your face I haven't kissed
    You step a little closer each day
    and I can't say what's going on
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[C#]Stones \[F#]taught me to \[G#]fly
    \[C#]Love \[F#]taught me to \[G#]lie
    \[C#]Life \[F#]taught me to \[G#]die
    So it's not \[D#m7]hard to fall
    When you \[F#]float like a \[G#]cannon\[B&m]ball
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Still a little bit of your song in my ear
    Still a little bit of your words I long to hear
    You step a little closer to me
    So close that I can't see what's going on
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    Stones taught me to fly
    Love taught me to cry
    So come on courage, teach me to be shy
    'Cause it's not hard to fall
    And I don't want to scare her
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
    It's not hard to fall
    And I don't wanna lose
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
    It's not hard to grow
    When you know that you just don't know
  \endchorus
