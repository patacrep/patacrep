  \beginverse
    \[G]Love is a \[C]burning \[G]thing
    And it makes a \[C]firery \[G]ring
    Bound by \[C]wild \[G]desire
    I fell into a \[C]ring of \[G]fire
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[D]I fell into a \[C]burning ring of \[G]fire
    I went \[D]down, down, down
    And the \[C]flames went \[G]higher
    And it \[G]burns, burns, burns
    The \[C]ring of \[G]fire \rep{2}
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    The taste of love is sweet
    When hearts like ours meet
    I fell for you like a child
    Oh, but the fire went wild
  \endverse
