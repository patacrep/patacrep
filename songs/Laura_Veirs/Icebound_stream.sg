  \beginverse
    \[C#m]Watch, I can flash across the sky
    A lightning bolt from up on \[B]high
    And I can crash into my\[C#m]self
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Now, a flower blooms in reverse
    And a song takes back a verse
    A photograph fades to white
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    I can \[B]hold a thunderhead in my \[C#m]heart
    And in my \[B]bed, I can dream a winter's \[C#m]gale
    And wake up drenched, a stormy pale, a stormy pale
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    A battered \[C#m]heath on the shore
    Will make her keep and wait for more
    But under\[B]neath her icebound stream
    The water \[C#m]pours, the water pours
  \endverse
