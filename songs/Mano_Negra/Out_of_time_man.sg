  \beginverse
    Time don't fool me no more
    I throw my watch to the floor, it's so lazy
    Time don't do it again
    Now I'm stressed and strained with anger and pain in the subway train
  \endverse

    Now it's half past two \echo{Long gone the rendez-vous}
    Now it's half past three \echo{Time made a fool out of me}
    Now it's half past four \echo{Baby can't you see}
    No use in waiting no more \echo{It's a timing tragedy}
