  \beginverse
    When you were here before\[G]
    Couldn't look you in the eye\[B]
    You're just like an angel\[B#]
    Your skin makes me cry\[Cm]
    You float like a feather\[G]
    In a beautiful world\[B]
    I wish I was special\[B#]
    You're so fuckin' special\[Cm]
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
    What the hell am I doing here?
    I don't belong here
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    I don't care if it hurts
    I want to have control
    I want a perfect body
    I want a perfect soul
    I want you to notice
    When I'm not around
    You're so fuckin' special
    I wish I was special
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    She's running out again
    She's running out
    She run, run, run, run, run{\dots}
    Whatever makes you happy
    Whatever you want
    You're so fuckin' special
    I wish I was special{\dots}
