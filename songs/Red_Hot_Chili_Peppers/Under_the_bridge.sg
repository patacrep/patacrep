  \begin{verse}
    \[E] Sometimes \[B]I feel like I \[C#m]don't have a \[G#m]part\[A]ner
    \[E] Sometimes \[B]I feel like \[C#m]my only \[A]friend
    Is the \[E]city I \[B]live in, the city of angels, the \[C#m]city of \[G#m]an\[A]gels
    \[E]Lonely as \[B]I am \[C#m]together we \[A]cry \[EM7]
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
    I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
    She sees my good deeds and she kisses the winded
    I never worried, now that is a lie
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[F#m]{I don't} ever want to \[E]feel
    \[B] Like I \[F#m]did that day
    \[F#m]Take me to the place I \[E]love
    \[B] Take me \[F#m]all the way
    \rep{2}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
    It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
    At least I have her love, the city she loves me
    Lonely as I am together we cry
  \end{verse}

  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    \[A]Under the bridge \[C]down-town
    \[G6]is where I\[FM7] drew some blood
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    I could not get enough
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    Forgot about my love
  \end{verse*}

  \begin{verse*}
    Under the bridge down-town
    I gave my life away
  \end{verse*}

    Oh no no no, yeah, yeah \rep{4}
