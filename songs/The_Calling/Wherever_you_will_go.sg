  \endverse

  \beginverse
    \[C]So lately \[C/B]you're wondering
    \[Am7]Who will be \[F]there to take my place
    When I'm gone, you'll need love
    To light the shadows on your face
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    If a great wave shall fall
    And fall upon us all
    Then between the sand and stone
    Could you make it on your own?
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    If I could, then I would
    I'll go wherever you will go
    Way up high or down low
    I'll go wherever you will go
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    And maybe I'll find out
    A way to make it back someday
    To want you, to guide you
    Through the darkest of your days
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    If a great wave shall fall
    And fall upon us all
    Then I hope there's someone out there who
    Can bring me back to you
  \endverse

  \musicnote{\Chorus}

  \beginverse*
    \[F]Run away with my \[C/B]heart
    \[Em]Run away with my \[Am7]hope
    \[F]Run away with my \[C/B]love
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    I know now just quite how
    My life and love might still go on
    In your heart, in your mind
    I'll stay with you for all of time
  \endverse

  \musicnote{\Chorus}

  \beginchorus
    If I could turn back time
    I'll go wherever you will go
    If I could make you mine
    I'll go wherever you will go
