  \beginverse
    \[G]Step one you say we \[D4]{need to talk}
    He w\[Em]alks you say sit do\[D]wn it's j\[D4]{ust a} ta\[G]lk
    He smiles pol\[D4]{itely back} to y\[Em]ou
    You stare pol\[D]itely ri\[D4]{ght on} thr\[G]ough
    Some sort of wi\[D4]{ndow to your} r\[Em]ight
    As he goes le\[D]ft and y\[D4]{ou stay} ri\[G]ght
    Between the li\[D4]{nes of fear} and b\[Em]lame
    And you begin to wo\[D]nder w\[D4]{hy you} came
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    Wh\[C]ere did I go w\[D]rong, I lost a fr\[Em]iend
    Somewhere al\[G]ong in the bit\[D4]terness
    And \[C]{I would} have stayed \[D]{up with} you all n\[Em]ight
    Had I known h\[G]ow to save a l\[D4]ife
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Let him know that you know best
    Cause after all you do know best
    Try to slip past his defense
    Without granting innocence
    Lay down a list of what is wrong
    The things you've told him all along
    Pray the God he hears you
    And pay the God he hears you
  \endverse

  \musicnote{\Chorus}

  \beginverse
    As he begins to raise his voice
    You lower yours and grant him one last choice
    Drive until you lose the road
    Or break with the ones you've followed
    He will do one of two things
    He will admit to everything
    Or he'll say he's just not the same
    And you'll begin to wonder why you came
  \endverse
