  \beginverse
    It started in base\[F#]ments
    \[B] And it started in \[F#]sheds
    It started in back\[F#]yards
    \[B] And was hidden under \[F#]beds
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    \[E] I turned on the TV
    \[B] Don't believe a word they \[F#]say
    \[E] We can't stay here now love
    \[B] And we can't get away \[F#]
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[B] There's a riot on \[F#]sunset
    \[B] And fires burn in the \[F#]park
    \[B] The sun has \[F#]set my friend
    \[B] And California's dark \[A F#]
  \endchorus


  \beginverse
    And over the screaming
    I heard a clear voice
    I looked at my choices
    And I made a choice
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Smoke and ashes
    Tonight hide the stars
    The stop lights are red now, love
    We've come for what's ours
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Come stand among the rattlesnakes
    At the side of the desert road
    And close your eyes and listen
    To the music hard and cold
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Tonight the moon is blackened
    Tonight the doors are shut
    Behind the shuttered windows
    We pray the sun will come up
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    For something walks across these fields
    For which there is no name
    You might have heard different
    But I was there when it came
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    It will start with a spark
    And a great fire will grow
    Don't know how I know it
    But I just know
  \endverse


  \beginchorus
    There's a riot on sunset
    And fires burn in the park
    The sun sets everywhere
    And the whole damn country's dark
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
    There's a riot on Sunset
    And fires burn in the park
    The sun has set my friend
    And California's dark
  \endchorus
