  \beginverse
    There's a \[Em]man homeless and hungry
    There's a \[Am]wind that's hard and \[Em]biting
    There's a \[Em]song in need of singing
    There's a \[Am]fuse in need of \[Em]light
    It's no \[G]secret the day is \[Em]coming
    And it's a \[G]day I hope to \[Em]see
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    But if they \[Em]ask
    If they ask you \[Em]brother
    Who told you \[Am]that
    You didn't hear it fr\[Em]om me
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    Let \[G]freedom ring
    Let \[C]free\[C/B]dom \[Am]ring
    Let \[Am]freedom ring
    Let \[G]free\[F#]dom \[Em]ring
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    There's a book with seven seals
    There's a beast with seven heads
    There's seven angels on seven horses
    There's seven vials with seven plagues
    So if you hear, if you hear a knocking
    On that door, just let it be
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Where the righteous, where the righteous stood
    And where the righteous, where the righteous fell
    There's a voice, that's soft and whispering
    Coming from the bottom of the well
    And I tried hard to remember
    To remember what that voice said
    Over and over, over and over
    I repeated those words, inside my head
  \endverse

  \musicnote{chorus \rep{2}}

  \beginverse*
    And if they ask
    If they ask you brother
    Who told you that
    Tell them it was me
