  \beginverse
    I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
    With flowers and my love both never to come back
    I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
    Like a new born baby it just happens every day
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    I look inside myself and see my heart is black
    I see my red door and I want it painted black
    Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
    It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
    I could not foresee this thing happening to you
    If I look hard enough into the setting sun
    My love will laugh with me before the morning comes
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    I see a red door and I want to paint it black
    No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
    I have to turn my head until my darkness goes
  \endverse
