    I \[G]saw her today at the re\[C]ception
    A \[G]glass of wine in her \[C]hand

  \begin{verse}
    I went down to the demonstration
    To get my fair share of abuse
    Singing ``we're gonna vent our frustration
    And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse''

  \begin{verse}
    I went down to the Chelsea drugstore
    To get your prescription filled
    I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy
    And man, did he look pretty ill
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}

    And he said one word to me, and that was ``dead''
    I said to him:
  \end{verse*}


  \begin{verse}
    I saw her today at the reception
    In her glass was a bleeding man
    She was practiced at the art of deception
    Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands
  \end{verse}
