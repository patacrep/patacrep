  \beginchorus
    \[A]Well it's true that we love one another
    \[A]I love Jack White like a little brother
    \[E]Well, Holly, I love you \[D]too
    \[D]But there's just so much that I don't know about \[A]you
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    \[A]Jack, give me some money to pay my bills
    \[A]All the dough I give you, Holly, you've been using on pain pills
    \[D]Jack, will you call me if you're able?
    \[A]I've got your phone number written in the back of my Bible
    \[E]Jack, I think you're pulling my \[D]leg
    \[D]And I think maybe I'd better ask \[A]Meg
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
    You know I don't care 'cause Jack really bugs me
    Why don't you go ask him now?
    Well, I would but, Meg, I really just don't know how
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Just say, ``Jack, do you adore me?''
    Well, I would, Holly, but love really bores me
    Then I guess we should just be friends?
    I'm just kidding Holly, you know that I'll love you 'til the end
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Holly, give me some of your English lovin'
    If I did that, Jack, I'd have one in the oven
    Why don't you go off and love yourself?
    If I did that, Holly, there wouldn't be anything left for anybody else
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Jack, it's too bad about the way that you look
    You know, I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot
    Will the two of you cut it out?
    And tell 'em what it's really all about
  \endverse
