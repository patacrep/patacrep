  \beginverse
    While they're standing in the welfare lines
    Crying at the doorsteps of those armies of salvation
    Wasting time in the unemployment lines
    Sitting around waiting for a promotion
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    D\[G]on't you \[Cadd9]know
    \[Em]They're talkin' about \[Dsus4]a revolu\[G]tion
    It\[Cadd9]sounds \[Em]like \[D]a whisper
    Don't you know
    They're talkin' about a revolution
    It sounds like a whisper
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Poor people gonna rise up
    And get their share
    Poor people gonna rise up
    And take what's theirs
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    Don't you know
    You better run, run, run{\dots}
    Oh I said you better
    Run, run, run{\dots}
    Finally the tables are starting to turn
    Talkin' about a revolution
  \endchorus
