    It's \[G]been the usual su\[D]nday with a flu \[Bm]
    \[G]And I just can't \[D]get over you \[Bm]
  \endverse

    Burnt my toast and lost your number
    Cut my finger, spilled my beer
    It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
    And I just can't get over you
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    I \[G]put your stockings
    \[D]In my purple boots \[Bm]
    \[G]What if I do\[D]n't get over you? \[Bm]
  \endchorus

    Had a chat and left my hat
